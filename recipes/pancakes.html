            <h3>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</h3>
            <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                </ol>
