            <h3>We love lemon-pepper wings, especially during football season.</h3>
            <p>I got tired of spending so much money on them that I decided to whip up my own version of Wingstop's lemon-pepper chicken wings. The end result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
                <li>12 chicken wings</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Stir olive oil and lemon-pepper seasoning together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Fry wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Toss hot wings with lemon-pepper mixture to coat.</li>
            </ol>
